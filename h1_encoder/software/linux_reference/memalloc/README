                            What is memalloc?
===============================================================================

memalloc is a test environment specific memory allocation kernel driver.
It uses memory left outside linux memory management, devides it into chunks and
gives base addresses to processes for these chunks(= a block of memory).

It has been written for test memory purposes for a very specific test
environment and nothing more.

                    Loading the memalloc kernel driver
===============================================================================

NOTE: Check the kerner source path in the makefile! there are some predefined
paths for 2.6.9 or 2.6.16 kernels.

1. Use the tool-chain workstation, similarly like in "Setting up the
environment".

2. compile the kernel driver in software/linux_reference/memalloc
> make

3. Copy the loading script memalloc_load.sh and the kernel object memalloc.ko
to /export/work/yourwork_dir

4. For testing load kernel driver with:
>./memalloc_load.sh alloc_method=2

5. Debugging:
the device node should show up in the the directory /tmp/dev
The device should show up in the list /proc/devices
> ls /tmp/dev
> cat /proc/devices
Kernel messages can be viewed with
> dmesg
More kernel debug prints can be enabled in the Makefile
